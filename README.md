## Installing Plugin
- Open Joplin
- Go to Tools > Options > Plugins
- Search for `Templates`
- Click Install plugin
- Restart Joplin to enable the plugin

## Importing Legacy Templates
- If you were already using the legacy version of templates, your templates will be automatically imported once you install the plugin. They will appear in an `Imported Templates - dd/mm/yyyy` notebook. See the `README` note in that notebook for more details.

- Your existing templates will still be present in the templates directory but will be renamed from `.md` to `.md.old`. You can safely delete these old templates once you verify that they've been imported correctly in Joplin.

## Using the Template Plugin

### Adding a new template
Create templates by creating a new note or to-do in any notebook that:
- Includes your template content
- Is tagged with `template`

### Using templates
You can access the templates options in `Tools` > `Templates`.

## Features

### Template variables

#### Built in variables
Built in variables are inserted automatically, without interaction from you. For example, in the following template, the date will be automatically added:

```markdown
Date: {{date}}
Hours:
Details:
```

The currently supported built in template variables are:

| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{{date}}` | Today's date  | 2019-01-01 |
| `{{time}}` | Current time  | 13:00 |
| `{{datetime}}` | Current date and time  | 01/01/19 1:00 PM |
| `{{#custom_datetime}}` | Current date and/or time formatted based on a supplied string (using [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) formatting) | `{{#custom_datetime}}M d{{/custom_datetime}}` |
| `{{bowm}}` | Date of the beginning of the week (when week starts on Monday) | |
| `{{bows}}` | Date of the beginning of the week (when week starts on Sunday) | |

> **NOTE**: All dates are formatted based on your Joplin settings in `General > Date Format`

#### Custom variables
You can also define custom variables in your template that prompt you to enter a value when you use the template. For example in the following example the name and color variables will prompt you each time you use the template:

```markdown
---
name: text
color: enum(Red, Yellow, Green)

---

Hi there, {{ name }}. Your favorite color is {{ color }}. This note/to-do was created on {{ datetime }}.
```

The currently supported custom variable types are:

| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `text` | name: text |
| `number` | count: number |
| `boolean` | show_summary: boolean |
| `enum` (dropdown list) | color: enum(Red, Yellow) |

You can't use special characters ("@", ",", "#", "+", "(", etc.) or spaces in variable names. However, you can use "_" in variable names.

> **NOTE**: If you declare a custom variable with same name as the built-in variables, the custom variable value will be used.

Internally, [Handlebars.Js](https://handlebarsjs.com/) is used to compile the templates. You can write templates to be compatible with `Handlebars`.

### Default Templates
You can define the templates you use the most as default templates. Currently you can have two default templates. One for `notes` and one for `to-dos`. You can also assign keyboard shortcuts to these defaults, so that you can quickly create a new note/to-do with the respective default template.

## Changelog
